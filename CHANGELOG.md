# Changelog

## 6.7.0 (unpublished)

- Significantly improve XPath evaluation [performance](https://github.com/renggli/dart-xml/issues/194#issuecomment-3311509567) for large documents.
- Add missing XPath name tests (namespace prefix, namespace URI, local name, and wildcards) and node tests (`attribute()`, `document-node()` and `element()`).
- Fix issues with XPath [axis parsing](https://github.com/renggli/dart-xml/issues/193), [reverse axis access](https://github.com/renggli/dart-xml/issues/194), and [predicate expressions](https://github.com/renggli/dart-xml/issues/194).

## 6.6.1

- Dart and Flutter 3.9 compatibility.
- Minor optimization to eliminate unused namespaces.

## 6.6.0

- Dart 3.8 and PetitParser 7.0 requirement.
- Correct decoding of names with surrogate characters.

## 6.5.0

- Add support for most XPath 1.0 functions, including set-operations and ensuring document order for node-sets.
- Add support for XPath expression evaluation, user-defined variables, and user-defined functions.
- Add `XmlNode.xpathGenerate` to create a readable XPath for all nodes.
- Add support for node comparison: `XmlNode.isEqualNode` and `XmlNode.compareNodePosition`.

## 6.4.0

- Dart 3.0 and PetitParser 6.0 requirement.
- Add RSS feed reader example.

## 6.3.0

- Upgrade to Dart 2.19 and PetitParser 5.4.
- Add `XmlElement.tag` constructor that greatly simplifies the creation of elements, i.e. `XmlElement(XmlName('br'), [], [], true)` becomes `XmlElement.tag('br', isSelfClosing: true)`.
- Deprecate the ambiguous `XmlNode.text`: Replace with `XmlNode.value` to access the textual contents of the node, or `XmlNode.innerText` to access the textual contents of its descendants.
- Fix `XmlNode.siblings` and various related methods to also work correctly on `XmlAttribute` nodes, make the method return a mutable list.
- Improve `XmlNode.replace(XmlNode)` and add `XmlNode.remove()` for easy removal of a node.
- Improve error position propagation when building the XML DOM.
- Make the parser more forgiving when reading attributes.
- Experimental support of a subset of XPath.
- Add new-line normalization support.

## 6.2.0

- Upgrade to PetitParser 5.1 brings a 10% speed improvement (typed sequences).
- Add the ability to tap into a stream of `XmlEvent` with `tapEachEvent` (similar to `forEachEvent`).
- Remove `XmlName` equality operator `==` and `hashCode`. This is inconsistent with the other DOM nodes, and the provided implementation might not have the desired behavior.
- Improved error reporting when accessing `innerText` or `innerXml` on DOM nodes that cannot have children.

## 6.1.0

- Dart 2.17 requirement.
- Validate the presence and order of root nodes when parsing; this got lost in 6.0.0 and can now also optionally be enabled for streaming and iterable parsers.
- Add support for basic document type parsing. The contents of the `XmlDoctype` can now be accessed through `name`, `externalId` and `internalSubset`.

## 6.0.0

- Significantly improve parsing performance by up to 30%.
- Improved error handling to include more information, such as tag names and location in the parsed source.
- Use the pull-based parser for all underlying parsing operations:
  - Reduce size of library by removing duplicated parsing and validation functionality.
  - Fix entity decoding if the entity spawns multiple chunks.
- Cleanup dynamic calls and type declarations:
  - Avoid all dynamic calls across the library (thanks to [srawlins](https://github.com/srawlins)).
  - Remove deprecated `XmlTransformer` as it requires dynamic calls in the `XmlVisitor`.
  - Cleanup the dynamic typing of `XmlVisitor`.
- `XmlBuilder` keeps keeps correct nesting, even in case of exceptions.
- Remove deprecated code:
  - `parse(String input)`: use `XmlDocument.parse(String input)` or `XmlDocumentFragment.parse(String input)` instead.
  - `XmlBuilder.build()`: use `XmlBuilder.buildDocument()` or `XmlBuilder.buildFragment()` instead.
  - `XmlNormalizer.defaultInstance`: use `const XmlNormalizer()` instead.
  - `XmlProductionDefinition`, `XmlGrammarDefinition`, and `XmlParserDefinition`.

## 5.4.0

- Dart 2.16 requirement.
- Update to PetitParser 5.0.
- Escape control characters (thanks to [rspilker](https://github.com/rspilker)).
- Add a predicate to pretty printer to insert a space character before self-closing elements (thanks to [rspilker](https://github.com/rspilker)).
- Add predicates to normalizer to trim leading and trailing whitespaces, as well as collapse consecutive whitespaces.
- Expose `qualifiedName`, `localName`, `namespacePrefix` and `namespaceUri` for convenience on the named nodes.

## 5.3.0

- Dart 2.15 requirement.
- Upgrade to PetitParser 4.3.

## 5.2.0

- A series of read-only accessors that simplify navigating the XML DOM with `XmlElements`:
  - Add `XmlNode.childElements`.
  - Add `XmlNode.siblings` and `XmlNode.siblingElements`.
  - Add `XmlNode.previousElementSibling` and `XmlNode.nextElementSibling`.
  - Add `XmlNode.ancestorElements`, `XmlNode.precedingElements`, `XmlNode.descendantElements`, and `XmlNode.followingElements`.

## 5.1.1

- Fix printing of Exceptions.
- Fix parsing of DOCTYPE tags.

## 5.1.0

- Upgrade to PetitParser 4.1.0.

## 5.0.0

- Dart 2.12 requirement and null-safety.
- Add the possibility to `XmlBuilder` to add raw strings.
- Improve error reporting (particularly for fragment parsing).
- Default entity mapping is now a global setting.
- Improve tutorials and documentation.

## 4.5.0

- Fixed a bug in the XML name parsing where certain unicode planes were not correctly recognized.
- Removed const constructor from `XmlEvent` to be able to add a lazy initialized `parentEvent` field.
- Add `XmlWithParentEvents` that provides validation of event nesting and efficient access to the parent events. Use `stream.withParentEvents()` to annotate the stream accordingly.
- Add namespace resolution to events through `event.namespaceUri`. Note that the data is only available when the parent information is present (see above).
- Fix namespace resolutions for events in selected sub-tree nodes, even if the namespace declaration is not part of the visible DOM.
- Add `stream.forEachEvent(onText: ...)` for easier callback based stream processing.

## 4.4.0

- Add a `XmlSubtreeSelector` that allows efficient filtering of events in specific sub-trees. Use `stream.selectSubtreeEvents(...)` to filter the stream accordingly.
- Add more options to XML pretty printer, namely the possibility to sort and indent attributes.
- Add typed extension methods for all stream converters, for simpler and more fluent API.
- Improvements to documentation and examples.

## 4.3.0

- Improve error reporting of `XmlBuilder` and add possibility to build `XmlDocumentFragments`.
- Improvements to documentation and examples.

## 4.2.0

- Deprecate standalone `XmlDocument parse(String input)` method, and introduce factory methods in the respective nodes `XmlDocument.parse(String input)` and `XmlDocumentFragment.parse(String input)`.
- Introduce getters and setters for `XmlNode.innerText` (in most cases an alias to `XmlNode.text`), `XmlNode.innerXml` and `XmlNode.outerXml`.
- Improved support for `XmlDocumentFragment` across the library.
- Remove the `XmlDocument.text` override, which returned `null`.
- Add `XmlNode.replace(XmlNode other)` to make it easier to replace nodes in an existing tree.
- Add `XmlNode.getElement(String name)` as a shortcut to find the first child element with a given name.
- Add `XmlNode.firstElementChild` and `XmlNode.lastElementChild` to easy access the first/last child element.
- Add support to selectively disable whitespace normalization while pretty-printing, for example `document.toXmlString(pretty: true, preserveWhitespace: (node) => node is XmlElement && node.name.local == 'pre')` would keep everything within `<pre>` tags as-is.

## 4.1.0

- Improve the pretty printing and the customization of the pretty printing:
  - `XmlWriter` and `XmlPrettyWriter` are now initialized with optional arguments.
  - Pretty printing now also supports to customize the newline support.
  - Example is updated to also syntax highlight / colorize the output.
- Add full namespace support to attribute accessors `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute`.
- Improved the documentation, particularly started a section on `xml_events` package.

## 4.0.0

- Cleanup the node hierarchy. Specifically removed `XmlOwned` and `XmlParent` that added a lot of complexity and confusion. Instead, introduced dedicated mixins for nodes with attributes (`XmlHasAttributes`), children (`XmlHasChildren`), names (`XmlHasName`) or parents (`XmlHasParent`).
- Introduce `XmlDeclaration` nodes, events and builder to make accessing XML version and encoding simpler.

## 3.7.0

- Update to PetitParser 3.0.0.
- Dart 2.7 compatibility and requirement.

## 3.6.0

  read or write XML can now (optionally) be configured with an entity mapper.
- The default entity mapping used only maps XML entities, as opposed to all HTML entities as in
  previous versions. To get the old behavior use `XmlDefaultEntityMapping.html5`.
- Made `XmlParserError` a `FormatException` to follow typical Dart exception style.
- Add an example demonstrating the interaction with HTTP APIs.

## 3.5.0

- Dart 2.3 compatibility and requirement.
- Turn various abstract classes into proper mixins.
- Numerous documentation improvements and code optimizations.
- Add an event parser example.

## 3.4.0

  - 15-30% faster DOM parsing, and
  - 15-50% faster event parsing.
- Improve error messages and reporting.

## 3.3.0

- New events based parsing in `xml_events`:
  - Lazy event parsing from an XML string into an `Iterable` of `XmlEvent`.
  - Async converters between streams of XML, `XmlEvent` and `XmlNode`.
